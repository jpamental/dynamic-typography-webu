      <h1>The Odyssey, Book I</h1>
      <h2>A story by Homer</h2>
      <p>Tell me, <em>O muse</em>, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide 
        after he had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit, and 
        many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted; 
        moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life and bring 
        his men safely home; but do what he might he could not save his men, for they 
        perished through their own sheer folly in eating the cattle of the Sun-god 
        Hyperion; so the god prevented them from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, 
        about all these things, <strong>O daughter of Jove</strong>, from whatsoever 
        source you may know them.

      <p>So now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely home 
        except Ulysses, and he, though he was longing to return to his wife and 
        country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had got him into a large 
        cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by, there came a time when 
        the gods settled that he should go back to Ithaca; <em><strong>even then,</strong></em> however, when 
        he was among his own people, his troubles were not yet over; nevertheless all 
        the gods had now begun to pity him except Neptune, who still persecuted him 
        without ceasing and would not let him get home. </p>
